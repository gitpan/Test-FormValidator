Revision history for Test-FormValidator

0.04    October 11, 2005
        - fixed bug with invalid_ok where the presense of extra fields
          in %fields_and_constraints spec wasn't considered a test
          failure

0.03    October 11, 2005
        - added 'prefix()'
        - changed 'comment' to 'description' throughout (Test::Simple
          calls it 'name', but the TAP doc calls it 'description'.
          Either way, 'comment' is wrong)

0.02    October 11, 2005
        - minor pod fixes
        - t/testform.html was missing from distribution

0.01    October 10, 2005
        - First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
