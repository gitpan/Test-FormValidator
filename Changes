Revision history for Test-FormValidator

0.03    October 11, 2005
        - added 'prefix()'
        - changed 'comment' to 'description' throughout (Test::Simple
          calls it 'name', but the TAP doc calls it 'description'.
          Either way, 'comment' is wrong)

0.02    October 11, 2005
        - minor pod fixes
        - t/testform.html was missing from distribution

0.01    October 10, 2005
        - First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
